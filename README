# About
This is an individual task of the Compilers course.

The goal was: to make PHP lexer using pure C++ and Finita Automata concepts.

# Usage
    To run lexer you'll need LexerRunner.

0. You may recompile LexerRunner.cpp if needed (you don't have to):
    $ g++ LexerRunner.cpp -o LexerRunner PHPLexer.cpp
    Don't care about warnings.

1. Run the following command to the console to get help:
    $ ./LexerRunner

2. You can insert your code as an argument:
    $ ./LexerRunner --code '$var1 = 30'

3. Use it with premade examples or your files
    $ ./LexerRunner --filename examples/general.php

4. You can modify the LexerRunner.cpp file, recompile and run as following it to debug if needed:
    $ ./LexerRunner --debug

5. The output will be a horizontal list with the structure <TokenType>: <Token value> as following:
    Identifier: $var1
    Operator: =
    Integer: 30
    End of file.
